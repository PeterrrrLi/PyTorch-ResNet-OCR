# PyTorch ResNet Transformer OCR
This is my personal project on Object Detection and OCR Recognition using Deep Learning Neural Networks.  
The project involves my personal practices on different architectures, loss functions, training techniques, data augmentation techniques, and more.   



## Models implemented:
- ResNet
- Multi-Head Self Attention Transformer
- W-Pod Net

## Framework used:
- PyTorch

## Dataset:
- CCPD

## Papers consulted:
- [TrOCR: Transformer-based Optical Character Recognition with Pre-trained Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.10282.pdf)
- [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf)
