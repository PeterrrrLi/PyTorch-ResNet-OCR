# PyTorch-ResNet-OCR
This is my personal project on Object Detection and OCR Recognition using Deep Learning Neural Networks.  
The project involves my personal practices on different architectures, loss functions, training techniques, data augmentation techniques, and more.   



## Models implemented:
- ResNet
- Multi-Head Self Attention
- W-Pod Net

## Framework used:
- PyTorch

## Dataset:
- CCPD
